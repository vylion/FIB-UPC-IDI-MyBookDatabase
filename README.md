# MyBookDatabase

Android app developed for the IDI course at FIB, UPC. January 2017

An app skeleton was given consisting only of a MySQLite helper class and an empty Main Activity. The app requested was an app to manage a list of favorite books' titles and metadata related to them. The project was intended for pairs of students (each student being assigned a specific half of the task by the teachers) but my teammate resigned before starting. This is the half that was assigned to me.
